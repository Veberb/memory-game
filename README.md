# Lepaya

- ## Description

  - This is a memory game requested as technical assignment.
  - I choose the memory game because description was more complete than service provider app and it'd be more funny to work with.

- ## Stack

  - React
  - Node
  - Express
  - Monorepo
  - Docker
  - Chackra - UI

- ## Stack Description

  - I used MERN ( without mongo xD ) stack because I felt more confortoble to develop the test. It's a stack that i'm used to work with so i'd be easier for me.
  - I choose docker-compose, because you dont have to worry about running yarn, frontend and backend. I just want you to care what really cares: easy run project and code.
  - Monorepo because it helpes when you need to share code, like eslint and prettier config.

- ## Running

  - In root folder, execute command: `docker-compose up --build`

- ## Project

  - After run docker command, wait for build and [Client](http://localhost:3000) and [Server](http://localhost:4000/) will be avaiable.
  - Client uses port 3000.
  - Backend uses port 4000.

* ## Future Features:
  - Config port's in project
  - Save user that is playing.
  - Track user score while playing.
  - Timer to show list of players record's.
